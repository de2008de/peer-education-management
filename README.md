# Introduction

Peer education is a program which aims to encourage college students to help each other with their academic problems. Peer educators can consolidate learnt knowledge by helping others. The program is also an ideal platform for making new friends. Students can seek help for their daily problems besides academic problems. This repo provides a tool for creating, storing, and retrieving informations about peer educators. Peer educators are allowed to check schedules, take attendances, and write journals through the Peer Education.
